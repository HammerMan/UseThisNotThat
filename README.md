# UseThisNotThat

Allows you to give any npc or follower an item, and forces her to use that item.
If it is a follower, he/she will use the last item you have him/her for that slot.
If it is a non-follower npc, you can persuade him/her (speach check) to use a specific item in their inventory, or give them a new one.  
Beware, do no try to take anything from them, or they will call the guards!
